## Selected Projects

- **PulseFlow AI - Offline Music Recommender & Recognizer**  
  Local, Shazam-style audio fingerprinting and CLAP-based embedding search with FAISS, plus LLM-generated transition notes. Runs fully on device via Ollama/HF small models.

- **Real-Time Market Sentiment Dashboard**  
  Dash app that fetches NewsAPI/Reddit, runs DistilBERT and TextBlob sentiment in parallel, and generates short market write-ups with GPT-2. Focus on fast preprocessing and clean UI.

## Working Principles

- Offline-first and resource-aware.  
- Clear evaluation and removals before adding complexity.  
- Small, explainable components; clean interfaces; strong defaults; documented constraints.
