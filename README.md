# Philippe Guerrier — Data & AI

I try to build practical data systems and ML applications with a focus on efficiency, offline capability, and clear business impact. My background spans Data Science, Analytics, and Information Systems. I enjoy creating projects: model training and evaluation, and lightweight UIs that make insights usable.

- Location: Paris, France
- Languages: English, French, German (B2/C1)
- Interests: AI for Music and Media, Quantum computing (Qiskit), AI in Medicine/Pharma, Information Systems, Business Intelligence, Robotics

## Now

- Data & Analytics Engineering 
- Building offline, resource-controlled ML pipelines for music understanding and recommendation

---

## Selected Projects

- **PulseFlow AI — Offline Music Recommender & Recognizer**  
  Local, Shazam-style audio fingerprinting and CLAP-based embedding search with FAISS, plus LLM-generated transition notes. Runs fully on device via Ollama/HF small models.

- **Real-Time Market Sentiment Dashboard**  
  Dash app that fetches NewsAPI/Reddit, runs DistilBERT and TextBlob sentiment in parallel, and generates short market write-ups with GPT-2. Focus on fast preprocessing and clean UI.

- **Quantum K-Means (Qiskit)**  
  Classical k-means using a quantum swap-test distance oracle on QASM simulator; compares clustering behavior under quantum-inspired distance.

- **Quantum Monte Carlo π (Qiskit)**  
  Parameterized circuits used as a randomness source to estimate π via Monte Carlo; convergence analysis across qubit counts and sampling regimes.

- **Information Systems UI — Click & Collect + Prize Wheel (Tkinter)**  
  Educational demo of a click-and-collect flow and gamified reward wheel with probabilistic outcomes.

- **Spark/Scala ML Engineering**  
  RDD-based clustering/regression and graph workloads on GCP clusters; emphasis on correctness, testing, and resource efficiency.

## Highlights

- Built end-to-end data/ML prototypes that are easy to run locally and explain to non-technical stakeholders.  
- Applied ML to real-world optimization (e.g., menu design and operations) with measurable gains in satisfaction, cost, and revenue.  
- Organized AI events and produced post-event documentation and training follow-ups (AI & Law at Dau’IA; SCIS at Sorbonne).

## Working Principles

- Offline-first and resource-aware.  
- Clear evaluation and removals before adding complexity.  
- Small, explainable components; clean interfaces; strong defaults; documented constraints.
